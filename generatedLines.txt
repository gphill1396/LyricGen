Path we laid ahead
Gotta make up your mind
Do you think that we did?
Well ride out
You went ahead and let yourself in
When the drum and bass sway it
The loved one is gone
What If that's the worst
Start our lives again
Crawl my way back
I just want to do it right again
I get the feeling of what we should do
The patterned kid couldnt wait to grow old
When It's Over
Leaving our mark, they know who we are
Corrupt system with a smile
And now I take it apart
Looking over at my fears
Key Stakeholders
27.0 release of our flagship product
Sometimes I wish I were dead so
The saturation of saturators
Doors are being opened
But at best the dreams are no longer in suspension
More time to self reflect
Quiet as in gone
And you a woman of fame
With the same excuse one expects
Agree with all of the things I say
Then adhere to well known patterns kid
Friends for the end
Gearing up
This is the life
Ill have a house by age 20 and a wife by 25!
The foresight at night
You wont
Am I just a fabricated machine
This should be the end of the song
Thatd be fine if we could
Framework
What can you do when your tank runneth over?
I forgot to do the same to myself
Sustained in air while reality goes on below
Life isnt fun
Make it through
Who am I
If it really doesn't matter
But you think youre so agile
Stepping on dry land
Johns on the main stage
But then whats my nature
Start lights being down in this empty room
A shoulder to spend the night
For you Id wait just one more day
Not your story to tell
I cause the damage
X_____ When You're Quite
Look at where we are now
I'm Looking At Your Best
Drink the juice
These facts which Im about to lay
At worse Ill slip back to running in default
Came Here
And why not want to fit in
Until I take every attack
I dont need to find out how it really is
Let me tell my story
Feel it cant feel it cant feel it cant feel it
We pushed our fates together
Where do you go when you can go anywhere?
Further and Further disconnected
Its nice to see some familiar faces in yet another one of these calls
Youve given me the floor before
And I Miss you
Ive become so distracted by what exists
What If That's the best
I could never do that
But I dont think that we should
between the first one and the latter
Designed with genuine feeling at heart
I cant pin down the depression
Well fuck it
Youre the fucking product of a
Ya better not miss
With the sonic lore he spouts
Does it put you on edge
When youre quiet
In a thousand years Id never find the -
But do you think we did the show
Seek those that bring progress
Putting down another come to bed text
We'd make it out alright
What am I really going to tell you
Why do I keep doing this to myself
Im in it until Im not
If you're debating what to pick
This is my current status address
When I see pancakes on my phone
Whats my story
When I open it I stop and ask myself what am I even looking for?
To Bring us Back
Escalating fears
And I wish this could last forever
I think Id be a baker
Theres discernable error in the
Trust that Im fine
That Ive stopped asking what could
No more serotonin back-order
Another story that my future holds
Im thankful for the foresight
Another one of those waves
That there is no wander left to reach for
Overconsumption
The Show that never was
Evaluated all legacy code
Not Everything Needs Recorded
Think of what we have been
Weve gotten scars and cut our teeth
Desire for approval
Yet it all still felt so brief
Others tell my story
Think what we could be
You hold out for the applause
Here let me make for you
Take another dance with someone with a better chance
Does it make you uncomfortable
Roll back a wind up car and let it burn out
We can push off one more fight
No Mans an Island
Not able to make much noise
When nobody knows
Ill tell you once
Im okay with it
The ability to absorb beauty has become so wide spread
What defines the success criteria
Making yourself fit in for benefit of others
Is that my nature?
But Im afraid Id screw it up when
Does it instruct how your day goes by
Turn over
I see the shadow of footsteps walking underneath the door
Wildlife abound
Say fuck it
Id love to write in pen
With this bottle of spirits
If it sees the light of day
Another John's On Stage
But trust that Im right
Twice I thought I had died
Hold me close and say goodnight
Removing the debt
Why cry when I know that I can rid it
Now dig on this
It tolls for thee
Now that better data has come along
This ones for my best friends
Youre only as good as your last meal
Trapped in cycle
Plummetting
Thrice I have been tried and
And we lean in putting nature to the test
Ill have all my ducks in order
It just might be the same
Is this what happens when you spend your life
The social chameleon
Shut your mouth I just cant forget it
Whatever Ive numbed
I wish I could forget it all
That Never Was
Ill have the day after figured out
Throw our memories to the sea
Living as a quiet
Washing your name out of my mouth
Feeling the low
Designed to respond to the nurture
Creeping out is Chopin
Or therell be dues that you have to pay
Remove the block
Molding yourself around others
The cycle begins anew
Three taps for I Love You
And a home where love begins
You always wanna stop them
It has to be this
Ignore the damage
You better not be wrong
I Could NeverEntertain those thoughts
And then the day after next
But what if I dont
Keep breathing that false air
All sitting round the couch
How it feels inside
Stow away
Channel of Doubt
But everything got poor taste
With nocturnes that sound broken
In the pursuit of danger
Tear down the block
What matters is the outcome
Ill pretend Ive made it
Inspiration for you
Im hopin for emotion
The ambiverted squid
A push to go deeper in the mind
From actually going forward
Take A Look
Nomans Island
I spent too much of my time trying to please everyone
The blending in with my surroundings
So dont be late
Making our way with the firey sun
I could finally see things from third perspective
Front load the design
Solitudes enticement
Sunrise
Does it put you to bed
You never offered your heart
Can we hold onto
Allow that thought to pass my mind
When whats reported is your problem
Smoke resting on your breath
Malice
Left your apple core out to rot overnight
The first night
