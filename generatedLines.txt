The foresight at night
Seek those that bring progress
Survive without asking
Another one of those waves
Not your story to tell
What If that's the worst
Just trust in yourself that you're doing things right.
The ability to absorb beauty has become so wide spread
More time to self reflect
Theres discernable error in the
When whats reported is your problem
Plummetting
But what if I dont
You better not be wrong
Take another dance with someone with a better chance
Im thankful for the foresight
Creeping out is Chopin
What am I really going to tell you
Is that my nature?
We'd make it out alright
Three taps for I Love You
Not able to make much noise
I wish I could forget it all
Came Here
Is all I'm good at finding what I could be good at?
If it really doesn't matter
We pushed our fates together
When the drum and bass sway it
Making yourself fit in for benefit of others
Doors are being opened
There's no winning against paranoia
Quiet as in gone
But at best the dreams are no longer in suspension
What matters is the outcome
You always wanna stop them
Molding yourself around others
The cycle begins anew
When It's Over
Removing the debt
When I open it I stop and ask myself what am I even looking for?
And we lean in putting nature to the test
I dont need to find out how it really is
Ill have the day after figured out
Washing your name out of my mouth
Another John's On Stage
Whether that's whatever
Not Everything Needs Recorded
Can we hold onto
But everything got poor taste
Evaluated all legacy code
I've run out of those I can be emotionally open to
Until I take every attack
Friends for the end
Stow away

Drink the juice
In the pursuit of danger
I've stopped being all of that for you, and what did it get me
Putting down another come to bed text
With nocturnes that sound broken
27.0 release of our flagship product
I just want to do it right again
I love X, it helps me get lost in the music. I love Y, it helps me get lost in the me.
What defines the success criteria
How it feels inside
Desire for approval
Thatd be fine if we could
Crawl my way back
Youve given me the floor before
Now dig on this
I spent too much of my time trying to please everyone
Ill tell you once
Im in it until Im not
I think Id be a baker
But you think youre so agile
But trust that Im right
Think of what we have been
Corrupt system with a smile
Or therell be dues that you have to pay
That Ive stopped asking what could
Further and Further disconnected
Does it make you uncomfortable
And I Miss you
When youre quiet
Looking over at my fears
Stepping on dry land
Keep breathing that false air
Overconsumption
Then adhere to well known patterns kid
At worse Ill slip back to running in default
Nomans Island
Let me tell my story
Making our way with the firey sun
Do I want to discover who I am?
Roll back a wind up car and let it burn out
Im hopin for emotion
Trust that Im fine
Who am I
Another story that my future holds
You wont
But do you think we did the show
Youre the fucking product of a
From actually going forward
What If That's the best
For you Id wait just one more day
I forgot to do the same to myself
Sustained in air while reality goes on below
I could finally see things from third perspective
Solitudes enticement
Now that better data has come along
Living as a quiet
And why not want to fit in
Escalating fears
Ill have a house by age 20 and a wife by 25!
Weve gotten scars and cut our teeth
Leaving our mark, they know who we are
I get the feeling of what we should do
I cant pin down the depression
This is the life
Well fuck it
Start lights being down in this empty room
Does it instruct how your day goes by
Life isnt fun
Sunrise
If you're debating what to pick
Channel of Doubt
Im okay with it
But then whats my nature
What can you do when your tank runneth over?
I see the shadow of footsteps walking underneath the door
In a thousand years Id never find the -
Why do I seek to appease?
I Could NeverEntertain those thoughts
Sometimes I wish I were dead so
A shoulder to spend the night
And now I take it apart
between the first one and the latter
Agree with all of the things I say
Trapped in cycle
When you smashed through the glass front door
The first night
The blending in with my surroundings
Key Stakeholders
Designed with genuine feeling at heart
What does life look like without that control
When I get this feeling, I'm urged to destroy
Whatever Ive numbed
If it sees the light of day
Turn over
With the same excuse one expects
Smoke resting on your breath
Youre only as good as your last meal
And you a woman of fame
Remove the block
Here let me make for you
Make it through
Feel it cant feel it cant feel it cant feel it
Left your apple core out to rot overnight
When I see pancakes on my phone
Do I do the things that I do just so that I can profit from them?
Ill have all my ducks in order
To Bring us Back
Tear down the block
Gotta make up your mind
Path we laid ahead
No more serotonin back-order
But Im afraid Id screw it up when
A push to go deeper in the mind
Twice I thought I had died
You went ahead and let yourself in
When nobody knows
This is my current status address
Ignore the damage
Ill pretend Ive made it
Is this what happens when you spend your life
It tolls for thee
Do you think that we did?
I could never do that
Well ride out
Does it put you on edge
Wildlife abound
You never offered your heart
Look at where we are now
Id love to write in pen
Say fuck it
Energy you don't know what to do with
The patterned kid couldnt wait to grow old
And a home where love begins
Ive become so distracted by what exists
Hold me close and say goodnight
Think what we could be
I'm Looking At Your Best
And then the day after next
Feeling the low
Tearing up paper
All sitting round the couch
Its nice to see some familiar faces in yet another one of these calls
X_____ When You're Quite
I cause the damage
Digging out hair follicles
It has to be this
I've never had the benefit of emotional outbursts
Does it put you to bed
Take A Look
Am I just a fabricated machine
Bending my fingers in ways they aren't supposed to
Ya better not miss
But I dont think that we should
The Show that never was
The social chameleon
This should be the end of the song
Malice
Front load the design
Why cry when I know that I can rid it
Framework
This ones for my best friends
Whats my story
Thrice I have been tried and
Start our lives again
It just might be the same
That there is no wander left to reach for
Make this expereience for others
Others tell my story
These facts which Im about to lay
That Never Was
So dont be late
The saturation of saturators
Redact it if needed
The ambiverted squid
You hold out for the applause
No Mans an Island
Why do I keep doing this to myself
Because if I can do the opposite of what my conscious is telling me to do, then I still have control over myself
To distract myself from that, I try to create
Slipping Back
Allow that thought to pass my mind
Shut your mouth I just cant forget it
Designed to respond to the nurture
Yet it all still felt so brief
Throw our memories to the sea
With the sonic lore he spouts
Inspiration for you
Johns on the main stage
The loved one is gone
We can push off one more fight
With this bottle of spirits
And that's my own fault
And I wish this could last forever
Gearing up
Where do you go when you can go anywhere?
