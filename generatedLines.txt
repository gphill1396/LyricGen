I wish I could forget it all
I cause the damage
So dont be late
Now that better data has come along
Escalating fears
For you Id wait just one more day
Start our lives again
Designed to respond to the nurture
But Im afraid Id screw it up when
Does it make you uncomfortable
And you a woman of fame
When It's Over
Ya better not miss
You never offered your heart
Im okay with it
You hold out for the applause
Drink the juice
Whats my story
Washing your name out of my mouth
Until I take every attack
It has to be this
Gearing up
Roll back a wind up car and let it burn out
More time to self reflect
But everything got poor taste
Gotta make up your mind
I Could NeverEntertain those thoughts
With the sonic lore he spouts
Well fuck it
Id love to write in pen
Smoke resting on your breath
That there is no wander left to reach for
The saturation of saturators
Do you think that we did?
What am I really going to tell you
Key Stakeholders
between the first one and the latter
I could finally see things from third perspective
Turn over
Whatever Ive numbed
Does it put you to bed
Remove the block
Take another dance with someone with a better chance
What matters is the outcome
Twice I thought I had died
All sitting round the couch
The blending in with my surroundings
And now I take it apart
Hold me close and say goodnight
And I Miss you
Feeling the low
Am I just a fabricated machine
Here let me make for you
I forgot to do the same to myself
Ill have a house by age 20 and a wife by 25!
Why cry when I know that I can rid it
Look at where we are now
Is this what happens when you spend your life
The social chameleon
Youve given me the floor before
Further and Further disconnected
Creeping out is Chopin
X_____ When You're Quite
Is that my nature?
It just might be the same
Thatd be fine if we could
Keep breathing that false air
You always wanna stop them
Or therell be dues that you have to pay
That Never Was
27.0 release of our flagship product
Ill have the day after figured out
I could never do that
The ability to absorb beauty has become so wide spread
The first night
Another one of those waves
Allow that thought to pass my mind
Making yourself fit in for benefit of others
This is my current status address
Tear down the block
Why do I keep doing this to myself
Designed with genuine feeling at heart
Crawl my way back
That Ive stopped asking what could
No Mans an Island
Channel of Doubt
And we lean in putting nature to the test
Wildlife abound
Making our way with the firey sun
If you're debating what to pick
The cycle begins anew
With this bottle of spirits
Doors are being opened
You went ahead and let yourself in
Overconsumption
But then whats my nature
Does it instruct how your day goes by
If it sees the light of day
Sunrise
What If that's the worst
But do you think we did the show
Agree with all of the things I say
Nomans Island
Leaving our mark, they know who we are
We'd make it out alright
Stow away
The patterned kid couldnt wait to grow old
You better not be wrong
Think of what we have been
Not able to make much noise
With nocturnes that sound broken
Yet it all still felt so brief
When the drum and bass sway it
When youre quiet
Im in it until Im not
Evaluated all legacy code
Start lights being down in this empty room
Another John's On Stage
Youre only as good as your last meal
Sometimes I wish I were dead so
We can push off one more fight
Not your story to tell
But at best the dreams are no longer in suspension
Living as a quiet
Thrice I have been tried and
Then adhere to well known patterns kid
Ill tell you once
Looking over at my fears
Make it through
Not Everything Needs Recorded
Came Here
But what if I dont
Weve gotten scars and cut our teeth
I spent too much of my time trying to please everyone
But trust that Im right
But I dont think that we should
We pushed our fates together
Others tell my story
Molding yourself around others
Its nice to see some familiar faces in yet another one of these calls
Another story that my future holds
What can you do when your tank runneth over?
Corrupt system with a smile
The foresight at night
It tolls for thee
Say fuck it
Can we hold onto
These facts which Im about to lay
And then the day after next
Quiet as in gone
When nobody knows
Three taps for I Love You
Life isnt fun
I just want to do it right again
Think what we could be
With the same excuse one expects
And why not want to fit in
How it feels inside
This should be the end of the song
Youre the fucking product of a
Ill have all my ducks in order
At worse Ill slip back to running in default
The ambiverted squid
From actually going forward
Take A Look
Seek those that bring progress
I dont need to find out how it really is
Left your apple core out to rot overnight
What defines the success criteria
Path we laid ahead
Desire for approval
What If That's the best
Johns on the main stage
Framework
Who am I
Ill pretend Ive made it
No more serotonin back-order
Ive become so distracted by what exists
Im thankful for the foresight
Throw our memories to the sea
If it really doesn't matter
Front load the design
I cant pin down the depression
I see the shadow of footsteps walking underneath the door
I get the feeling of what we should do
The loved one is gone
Does it put you on edge
In a thousand years Id never find the -
Solitudes enticement
Shut your mouth I just cant forget it
I'm Looking At Your Best
Theres discernable error in the
Feel it cant feel it cant feel it cant feel it
When I see pancakes on my phone
A shoulder to spend the night
This is the life
When whats reported is your problem
When I open it I stop and ask myself what am I even looking for?
Now dig on this
To Bring us Back
Where do you go when you can go anywhere?
You wont
And I wish this could last forever
And a home where love begins
Stepping on dry land
Removing the debt
In the pursuit of danger
Im hopin for emotion
Putting down another come to bed text
Ignore the damage
A push to go deeper in the mind
The Show that never was
Friends for the end
Inspiration for you
Sustained in air while reality goes on below
But you think youre so agile
Malice
This ones for my best friends
Plummetting
Let me tell my story
I think Id be a baker
Trapped in cycle
Well ride out
Trust that Im fine
