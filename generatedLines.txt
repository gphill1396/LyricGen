The loved one is gone
Front load the design
Another John's On Stage
between the first one and the latter
Youre only as good as your last meal
When It's Over
Living as a quiet
More time to self reflect
Is that my nature?
Its nice to see some familiar faces in yet another one of these calls
That Never Was
But Im afraid Id screw it up when
But everything got poor taste
And you a woman of fame
I dont need to find out how it really is
We pushed our fates together
Trust that Im fine
Putting down another come to bed text
Came Here
Doors are being opened
Whats my story
What If that's the worst
And we lean in putting nature to the test
All sitting round the couch
So dont be late
When I open it I stop and ask myself what am I even looking for?
Or therell be dues that you have to pay
Whatever Ive numbed
Turn over
Think what we could be
Framework
The ability to absorb beauty has become so wide spread
The foresight at night
Nomans Island
But I dont think that we should
Ill pretend Ive made it
For you Id wait just one more day
Channel of Doubt
Where do you go when you can go anywhere?
Roll back a wind up car and let it burn out
The ambiverted squid
What am I really going to tell you
I could finally see things from third perspective
Friends for the end
If it really doesn't matter
Making yourself fit in for benefit of others
Who am I
Because if I can do the opposite of what my conscious is telling me to do, then I still have control over myself
The first night
Not able to make much noise
There's no winning against paranoia
And a home where love begins
I get the feeling of what we should do
Youre the fucking product of a
Another story that my future holds
Does it put you on edge
I forgot to do the same to myself
This is my current status address
The blending in with my surroundings
A shoulder to spend the night
Im hopin for emotion
Why cry when I know that I can rid it
Johns on the main stage
Now that better data has come along
The cycle begins anew
X_____ When You're Quite
Leaving our mark, they know who we are
Ya better not miss
In a thousand years Id never find the -
Let me tell my story
You never offered your heart
Im thankful for the foresight
Youve given me the floor before
Further and Further disconnected
Sustained in air while reality goes on below
No Mans an Island
The social chameleon
Stow away
Until I take every attack
When you smashed through the glass front door
Washing your name out of my mouth
With the sonic lore he spouts
When I get this feeling, I'm urged to destroy
These facts which Im about to lay
You always wanna stop them
If you're debating what to pick
Does it put you to bed
I've run out of those I can be emotionally open to
Ill have a house by age 20 and a wife by 25!
Smoke resting on your breath
Remove the block
Keep breathing that false air
Crawl my way back
Do you think that we did?
It has to be this
Take A Look
Ill tell you once
Trapped in cycle
Thrice I have been tried and
Slipping Back
Start lights being down in this empty room
This ones for my best friends
Bending my fingers in ways they aren't supposed to
Drink the juice
Corrupt system with a smile
To Bring us Back
I wish I could forget it all
But trust that Im right
The Show that never was
In the pursuit of danger
And that's my own fault
But what if I dont
And why not want to fit in
Say fuck it
And I wish this could last forever
With nocturnes that sound broken
This should be the end of the song
Make it through
You went ahead and let yourself in
Can we hold onto
Sunrise
I just want to do it right again
Im in it until Im not
When youre quiet
It tolls for thee
When the drum and bass sway it
Stepping on dry land
Tearing up paper
Solitudes enticement
Does it instruct how your day goes by
Gearing up
Throw our memories to the sea
That Ive stopped asking what could
Designed to respond to the nurture
Id love to write in pen
Malice
When whats reported is your problem
If it sees the light of day
27.0 release of our flagship product
Hold me close and say goodnight
Shut your mouth I just cant forget it
Inspiration for you
Ill have all my ducks in order
A push to go deeper in the mind
I see the shadow of footsteps walking underneath the door
Yet it all still felt so brief
What matters is the outcome
It just might be the same
You wont
Desire for approval
Look at where we are now
When I see pancakes on my phone
How it feels inside
I've never had the benefit of emotional outbursts
When nobody knows
Is this what happens when you spend your life
But at best the dreams are no longer in suspension
But then whats my nature
Well ride out
What can you do when your tank runneth over?
I think Id be a baker
Weve gotten scars and cut our teeth
The patterned kid couldnt wait to grow old
And now I take it apart
We'd make it out alright
That there is no wander left to reach for
Key Stakeholders
But you think youre so agile
Take another dance with someone with a better chance
Thatd be fine if we could
You hold out for the applause
Digging out hair follicles
Others tell my story
Creeping out is Chopin
We can push off one more fight
Theres discernable error in the
To distract myself from that, I try to create
Start our lives again
I've stopped being all of that for you, and what did it get me
I could never do that
I cant pin down the depression
Three taps for I Love You
And then the day after next
Twice I thought I had died
Think of what we have been
At worse Ill slip back to running in default
With this bottle of spirits
Ignore the damage
Ive become so distracted by what exists
Does it make you uncomfortable
Tear down the block
Another one of those waves
Life isnt fun
Well fuck it
Now dig on this
I cause the damage
With the same excuse one expects
Designed with genuine feeling at heart
But do you think we did the show
Wildlife abound
Path we laid ahead
Sometimes I wish I were dead so
Looking over at my fears
Plummetting
Seek those that bring progress
You better not be wrong
Feeling the low
Allow that thought to pass my mind
Overconsumption
What If That's the best
Making our way with the firey sun
Then adhere to well known patterns kid
Why do I keep doing this to myself
Molding yourself around others
Not Everything Needs Recorded
I spent too much of my time trying to please everyone
Escalating fears
Evaluated all legacy code
Quiet as in gone
From actually going forward
Gotta make up your mind
I'm Looking At Your Best
Ill have the day after figured out
I Could NeverEntertain those thoughts
This is the life
What defines the success criteria
The saturation of saturators
Here let me make for you
Feel it cant feel it cant feel it cant feel it
And I Miss you
Im okay with it
Left your apple core out to rot overnight
Not your story to tell
Removing the debt
Agree with all of the things I say
No more serotonin back-order
Am I just a fabricated machine
What does life look like without that control
