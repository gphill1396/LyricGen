A push to go deeper in the mind
This is my current status address
The ability to absorb beauty has become so wide spread
Shut your mouth I just cant forget it
Framework
Stow away
When It's Over
Corrupt system with a smile
When the drum and bass sway it
You wont
Molding yourself around others
Washing your name out of my mouth
I cause the damage
Not Everything Needs Recorded
You never offered your heart
And you a woman of fame
Throw our memories to the sea
From actually going forward
It has to be this
Ill have the day after figured out
Plummetting
With the same excuse one expects
Designed with genuine feeling at heart
What am I really going to tell you
Path we laid ahead
These facts which Im about to lay
Further and Further disconnected
In the pursuit of danger
For you Id wait just one more day
Ill have all my ducks in order
Start lights being down in this empty room
The saturation of saturators
When nobody knows
That Ive stopped asking what could
Living as a quiet
The patterned kid couldnt wait to grow old
With this bottle of spirits
Ill pretend Ive made it
To Bring us Back
Crawl my way back
Make it through
But what if I dont
The foresight at night
Where do you go when you can go anywhere?
Take another dance with someone with a better chance
In a thousand years Id never find the -
Feel it cant feel it cant feel it cant feel it
The blending in with my surroundings
Evaluated all legacy code
If you're debating what to pick
Let me tell my story
The social chameleon
Sustained in air while reality goes on below
Thrice I have been tried and
What If that's the worst
This ones for my best friends
No Mans an Island
Am I just a fabricated machine
Do you think that we did?
between the first one and the latter
Key Stakeholders
Until I take every attack
You better not be wrong
But do you think we did the show
We pushed our fates together
So dont be late
Im thankful for the foresight
The cycle begins anew
I forgot to do the same to myself
I could never do that
What If That's the best
It tolls for thee
Can we hold onto
Im in it until Im not
When I see pancakes on my phone
Does it put you on edge
I just want to do it right again
Now dig on this
And I Miss you
I see the shadow of footsteps walking underneath the door
I think Id be a baker
Is that my nature?
Roll back a wind up car and let it burn out
Sometimes I wish I were dead so
I cant pin down the depression
At worse Ill slip back to running in default
I Could NeverEntertain those thoughts
Think of what we have been
You always wanna stop them
Malice
Well fuck it
This is the life
And I wish this could last forever
I wish I could forget it all
Removing the debt
Is this what happens when you spend your life
You went ahead and let yourself in
Johns on the main stage
But at best the dreams are no longer in suspension
Well ride out
Life isnt fun
Escalating fears
I dont need to find out how it really is
It just might be the same
Im okay with it
And a home where love begins
Leaving our mark, they know who we are
Youre only as good as your last meal
Id love to write in pen
Another story that my future holds
We can push off one more fight
And why not want to fit in
Think what we could be
Wildlife abound
Gotta make up your mind
This should be the end of the song
That Never Was
Hold me close and say goodnight
Creeping out is Chopin
When whats reported is your problem
Trapped in cycle
But I dont think that we should
You hold out for the applause
Im hopin for emotion
Who am I
Or therell be dues that you have to pay
Making our way with the firey sun
Gearing up
Turn over
Then adhere to well known patterns kid
We'd make it out alright
All sitting round the couch
Drink the juice
Not able to make much noise
But you think youre so agile
The first night
Allow that thought to pass my mind
Sunrise
Agree with all of the things I say
I get the feeling of what we should do
Here let me make for you
Does it instruct how your day goes by
Say fuck it
But trust that Im right
If it really doesn't matter
But everything got poor taste
I'm Looking At Your Best
27.0 release of our flagship product
What defines the success criteria
Friends for the end
No more serotonin back-order
X_____ When You're Quite
When youre quiet
Does it put you to bed
Ill tell you once
But then whats my nature
Others tell my story
And we lean in putting nature to the test
Look at where we are now
I could finally see things from third perspective
Now that better data has come along
Youre the fucking product of a
Putting down another come to bed text
Why cry when I know that I can rid it
Whats my story
Whatever Ive numbed
Front load the design
Ive become so distracted by what exists
Keep breathing that false air
Its nice to see some familiar faces in yet another one of these calls
Youve given me the floor before
That there is no wander left to reach for
But Im afraid Id screw it up when
Inspiration for you
Take A Look
The Show that never was
When I open it I stop and ask myself what am I even looking for?
Another John's On Stage
And then the day after next
How it feels inside
Does it make you uncomfortable
Theres discernable error in the
If it sees the light of day
Doors are being opened
Designed to respond to the nurture
Not your story to tell
What can you do when your tank runneth over?
A shoulder to spend the night
Desire for approval
Start our lives again
Quiet as in gone
And now I take it apart
I spent too much of my time trying to please everyone
What matters is the outcome
Nomans Island
Remove the block
Trust that Im fine
With nocturnes that sound broken
Making yourself fit in for benefit of others
Left your apple core out to rot overnight
Thatd be fine if we could
Another one of those waves
The ambiverted squid
More time to self reflect
Solitudes enticement
With the sonic lore he spouts
Ya better not miss
Feeling the low
Ill have a house by age 20 and a wife by 25!
Three taps for I Love You
Tear down the block
Twice I thought I had died
Why do I keep doing this to myself
The loved one is gone
Yet it all still felt so brief
Channel of Doubt
Looking over at my fears
Smoke resting on your breath
Overconsumption
Ignore the damage
Weve gotten scars and cut our teeth
Came Here
Stepping on dry land
Seek those that bring progress
