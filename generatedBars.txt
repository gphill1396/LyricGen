When I see pancakes on my phone
When whats reported is your problem
Why cry when I know that I can rid it
Ill pretend Ive made it
Theres discernable error in the
Friends for the end
The foresight at night
I dont need to find out how it really is
In a thousand years I'd never, find the -
But Im afraid Id screw it up when
With this bottle of spirits
When the drum and bass sway it
We'll ride out
All sitting round the couch
Id love to write in pen
You never offered your heart
Shut your mouth I just cant forget it
With the sonic lore he spouts
Yet it all still felt so brief
Im thankful for the foresight
John's on the main stage
Take another dance with someone with a better chance
And I wish this could last forever
Im hopin for emotion
Crawl my way back
Trapped in cycle
But you think youre so agile
Doors are being opened
Feel it cant feel it cant feel it cant feel it
This ones for my best friends
Left your apple core out to rot overnight
With nocturnes that sound broken
Twice I thought I had died
When I open it I stop and ask myself what am I even looking for?
Weve gotten scars and cut our teeth
With the same excuse one expects
I see the shadow of footsteps walking underneath the door
Path we laid ahead
You always wanna stop them
Corrupt system with a smile
Putting down another come to bed text
Washing your name out of my mouth
Thatd be fine if we could
And now I take it apart
Smoke resting on your breath
Framework
Youre the fucking product of a
But I dont think that we should
Seek those that bring progress
Thrice I have been tried and
Creeping out is Chopin
Until I take every attack
And we lean in putting nature to the test
You went ahead and let yourself in
