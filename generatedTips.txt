Lastly, if you sampler as this feature, set it to play the sound forward and then in reverse non-stop as you hold a key downer. Your sampler may also have "fade" or loop settings to smooth out the edges. This will create a pretty seamless sample.

Typically people like to sidechain to amkick drum for the classic sidechain sound, but you can get really creative by trying oither instruments to sidechain to. The setting on your compressor will usually have the threshold between -30 and -50db, ratio around 5:1, a fast attack and the decay between 150-350ms.

You would record the sound being played in this space at twice the original speed (you can do this by sampling the original sound and playing it an octave up). You then take the results and play it at 1/2 speed. This will return the sound to it's original speed and pitch and give you the illusion of a much larger space.
