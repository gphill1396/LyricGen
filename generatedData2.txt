Start our lives again
You always wanna stop them
Another one of those waves
When I see pancakes on my phone
When the drum and bass sway it
I dont need to find out how it really is
And we lean in putting nature to the test
A push to go deeper in the mind
The loved one is gone
Keep breathing that false air
And then the day after next
Who am I
Further and Further disconnected
Youve given me the floor before
Malice
Now dig on this
Take another dance with someone with a better chance
What can you do when your tank runneth over?
Ive become so distracted by what exists
Smoke resting on your breath
Weve gotten scars and cut our teeth
Turn over
These facts which Im about to lay
Youre the fucking product of a
The ambiverted squid
You wont
With this bottle of spirits
Putting down another come to bed text
Friends for the end
Stepping on dry land
Crawl my way back
Front load the design
Yet it all still felt so brief
Creeping out is Chopin
When whats reported is your problem
Whats my story
Thrice I have been tried and
Others tell my story
I could finally see things from third perspective
Sustained in air while reality goes on below
Desire for approval
Overconsumption
Key Stakeholders
But you think youre so agile
Whatever Ive numbed
Evaluated all legacy code
Why do I keep doing this to myself
I think Id be a baker
But what if I dont
Feeling the low
Making yourself fit in for benefit of others
Throw our memories to the sea
Ignore the damage
Tear down the block
All sitting round the couch
But trust that Im right
So dont be late
I wish I could forget it all
Shut your mouth I just cant forget it
Roll back a wind up car and let it burn out
I spent too much of my time trying to please everyone
From actually going forward
But Im afraid Id screw it up when
Path we laid ahead
Ill tell you once
Ya better not miss

Then adhere to well known patterns kid
Think of what we have been
The foresight at night
Im okay with it
Thatd be fine if we could
Seek those that bring progress
Corrupt system with a smile
Living as a quiet
Ill have a house by age 20 and a wife by 25!
Is this what happens when you spend your life
In a thousand years Id never find the -
Doors are being opened
And I wish this could last forever
The social chameleon
How it feels inside
This is my current status address
Twice I thought I had died
No Mans an Island
When nobody knows
The patterned kid couldnt wait to grow old
Stow away
Trust that Im fine
Framework
Sometimes I wish I were dead so
With the sonic lore he spouts
The cycle begins anew
We'd make it out alright
For you Id wait just one more day
Plummetting
Or therell be dues that you have to pay
The ability to absorb beauty has become so wide spread
And why not want to fit in
We pushed our fates together
More time to self reflect
It tolls for thee
Wildlife abound
What am I really going to tell you
This ones for my best friends
Id love to write in pen
The saturation of saturators
Left your apple core out to rot overnight
Removing the debt
Leaving our mark, they know who we are
But I dont think that we should
You never offered your heart
27.0 release of our flagship product
At worse Ill slip back to running in default
Gearing up
Solitudes enticement
Think what we could be
When youre quiet
Nomans Island
And you a woman of fame
What defines the success criteria
Washing your name out of my mouth
But at best the dreams are no longer in suspension
And now I take it apart
This is the life
Another story that my future holds
Im hopin for emotion
I just want to do it right again
Theres discernable error in the
Quiet as in gone
Drink the juice
When I open it I stop and ask myself what am I even looking for?
Its nice to see some familiar faces in yet another one of these calls
Making our way with the firey sun
Well ride out
Where do you go when you can go anywhere?
Molding yourself around others
Youre only as good as your last meal
Feel it cant feel it cant feel it cant feel it
Escalating fears
Sunrise
Am I just a fabricated machine
Ill have all my ducks in order
With the same excuse one expects
Remove the block
Ill pretend Ive made it
I cause the damage
Not able to make much noise
Until I take every attack
I forgot to do the same to myself
This should be the end of the song
No more serotonin back-order
Life isnt fun
Do you think that we did?
Make it through
Johns on the main stage
Designed to respond to the nurture
Why cry when I know that I can rid it
Look at where we are now
That Ive stopped asking what could
It just might be the same
The blending in with my surroundings
Im in it until Im not
Is that my nature?
Not your story to tell
You went ahead and let yourself in
I see the shadow of footsteps walking underneath the door
That there is no wander left to reach for
Im thankful for the foresight
In the pursuit of danger
The first night
Designed with genuine feeling at heart
But then whats my nature
And a home where love begins
Agree with all of the things I say
Ill have the day after figured out
Channel of Doubt
Let me tell my story
I cant pin down the depression
A shoulder to spend the night
Trapped in cycle
With nocturnes that sound broken
